## Introduction

I'm so happy you're here! Early 2023, I made the commitment to further my education and skills as a Full Stack Web Developer. Promarily, I have a background in Hospitality and Events which has fueled my self-starter attitude towards many projects. I have an effective track record of combining creativity and problem solving to develop user-friendly applications and strategies. 

This application was one of my first few projects and I have continously improved it as I continue to gain knowledge in programming languages. 

## Usage
